## Fatherhood

I've recently noticed that a lot of my negative thought patterns have changed rather significantly. This is in spite of a significant increase in my work stress. I don't believe any choice or life change is a silver bullet for "fixing" your internal world, but I do think that the self-discovery and self-improvement I did prior to having my daughter[^1] tangibly changed how I've been seeing the world after my daughter was born. My primary goal around this post is to discuss how I've previously dealt with negative situations or thought patterns and how a lot of those have seriously minimized or outright vanished now that I'm a father. **Again**, I am not claiming that this is the only reason I've changed. This feels like one of the most significant inflection points in my life, and I wasn't expecting that to be the case. At least, not in the way that it has been significant. As you grow up in a male body[^2], you gain a certain understanding of how fatherhood specifically might affect a person. For me, this started off as an feeling that that's when your life ends. This is in part related to [The Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:, but AMAB's[^3] are generally taught from a young age to feel negatively toward fatherhood and marriage. Culturally, American content made *"for the guys"* was[^4] a mixture of *"women bad or annoying"* comedy and *"[don't get] chained down by a family"* stories focused on young boys/men in some sort of action world or a man *"in a rut"* because of his *"stupid family"*. Around middle school, I started being interested in girls[^5], but still had an aversion to the concept of marriage or fatherhood because of the media I was exposed to. In highschool this hadn't really changed, but I began having an awareness of [The Trauma](#the-trauma):tm: in that I understood how badly a marriage could end up. This compounded the aversion I had because of societal norms with the fear I have from [The Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:. This made the decision for both marriage, and *eventually* fatherhood, very difficult to work through. Here's a few of the thoughts I had during both decisions:

1. Did I even want this?
2. Did I want this because I wanted this or because I was raised to want this by society?
3. You're just going to replicate your [Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:, why bother?
4. You won't be a good father/spouse because your rolemodels were terrible.
5. This is a huge change, and big life changes are scary.
6. What if it gets taken away? (divorce, death)
7. If it might end, why bother?

These specifically made it very hard to actually decide one way another. Luckily, I had a patient, loving, and understanding girlfriend/wife when going through these throes. Inevitably, I had to take the plunge despite these uncertainties. I can't say it's been a walk in the park with either, because nothing important is ever **truly** easy, but I can't imagine my life having gone any other way. I don't believe I'd have been able to work through [The Trauma](#the-trauma):tm: without my wife, and both my daughter and wife have made my life so impossibly full of joy.

### *The Trauma*

CW: hoarding, medical neglect, emotional neglect, negative self-talk, complex PTSD, non-specific domestic violence, self-harm

I pretty regularly have a hard time reckoning with how bad my childhood *truly* was. Very often, I find myself hedging with the description using phrases like:

1. I don't want to make it seem like my childhood was the worst ever.
2. I know plenty of other people have gone through worse.
3. It might have been bad, but it wasn't all bad.

In fact, I wanted to start this section off with one of these, and I had to actively stop myself from doing that. There is nothing wrong with discussing how terrible my childhood was. In fact, I believe it's important to enable visbility around the kind of emotional and physical neglect I was subjected to. Do I feel bad about putting my parents on blast like this? Absolutely. However, I feel as though if I had some other experiences like mine to compare to, it would have been much easier for me to come to grips with the trauma I was subjected to. I have no way of knowing how "common" trauma like this is, but it's always been hard for me to "feel better" about my childhood, in large part, because of the lack of people who *really* get it. Anyway, let's talk about trauma!

My parents are[^6] hoarders. I don't use that label lightly. My aunt, who died of stomach cancer shortly afterwards, was on the TBS show hoarders. Both of my parents come from a long line of hoarders, and I have many horror stories I could, **BUT WON'T**, tell. Right now, anyway. I use this to merely set the stage for how I grew up. I remember my father[^7] as very absent. My father got on disability very early into my childhood[^8], and basically became a stay-at-home dad. Sadly, that was the worst thing that could have happened to her, in my opinion. Outside of *few* exceptions, I remember my father sitting in front of the computer getting angry at people online. She did very little around the house, and even less to contribute to her fulfillment with life. I recognize now how truly unhappy she was, but she **still** makes those choices, so I'm unsure what's actually going on in her mind. My parents' relationship was fraught, to say the least. I remember my parents fighting *constantly* as a child. I can't recall exactly what they fought about generally, but I distinctly remember fights that were, on the surface, about household chores my father failed to do. My mother was a teacher the entirety of my memory, but she apparently worked as a consultant doing programming with things like COBOL. My relationship with my parents is, needless to say, quite complicated. There's an amount of empathy I have for my parents and both their situations, and amount of pride I have in my mother, but they failed me as parents.

[^7]: She is trans, so I am using her preferred pronouns here (she/her/hers)
[^8]: I was 10 or 11, I think

#### *The Failure*

Both of my parents are horrendous at emotionally connecting with me. After quite a bit of therapy, I finally have a good understanding of *why* that connection never happened. My current therapist[^9] recommended I read through "Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents," by Lindsay C. Gibson[^10]. In this book, I found an immense amount of understanding and reasoning for why I've felt how I do about my parents since I left my childhood home for college. Without attempting to synthesize the entire book into a quick blurb, the jist of it is that parents like the ones I have are more common than you'd realize, and there are varying degrees to how emotionally immature they are. These kinds of parents *all* contribute to some amount of emotional neglect for their children. To me, a large part of my trauma could have been managed through emotional connection early on in my childhood, but I didn't get that, so it sat dormant until I was far enough removed from the damaging family dynamic I grew up in to actually rear its ugly head.

Let me level with you: I remember **very** little of my early childhood. I have a few neutral/happy memories that I can actively recall when I was young. Outside of that, it's more or less blank. My memory during school seems to be better, but still was not great overall. I believe I was dealing with depression for a large portion of *at least* middle school and high school. This could be, in part, due to my undiagnosed [ADHD](#the-trauma), but I'll discuss that more in that section. Without a crystal ball, or some amount of biased retelling from my parents (one of whom is dead), I can't really know what this is due to. At this point, I'm pretty confident my lack of memory is a result of my parents' near constant fighting and some very bad things relatively early on in my childhood.

I have an innocuous[^11] memory of playing outside behind my childhood home with one of the ladies who ran the private daycare I went to as a small child. As I grew up, that memory still managed to stick with me and I was never really sure why. Of course, sometimes there's nothing specific about a memory that would make it stick with you. This one just confused me, though. Why would I remember this specifically instead of something with my parents or something happier? I don't remember how I felt at the time, but that's part of why it's so confusing to remember that specific snippet. Of course, I imagine people reading can see where this is going, that memory very well might still be innocuous, but it's more likely related to a particularly bad event at my house. My father's been through the gamut regarding psychiatric treament. She's been on, probably, every potential treatment possible for her mental illnesses[^12]. Based on things I've been told by other family members who heard about the incident, my dad reacted *really poorly* to one of these drugs. During this time, she was angry and throwing things around the house. My mom was scared she'd get hurt, and stood behind *me*[^13]. After my father stormed out of the room where this was happening, my mom called 911 to report what was happening. At that time, my father took some number of pills in an attempt to end her life. I don't remember *any* of this, but I do remember being outside, and seeing ambulances through our chainlink fence while I bounced a ball on our small patio. I was confused, and I probably didn't even really understand how scared I *should* have been.

Given this story was *told* to me, it's very possible I'm selectively remembering things that didn't actually occur to make sense of this specific memory. That said, it was what got my mom to tell me about it. Then, the story was expanded upon by my dad and uncle. I don't really know if retroactive trauma is possible, but it does make me immensely sad to think about. This was, I *think*, the worst it got based on what I've been told. There are plenty of other negative stories I've been told, however. In no particular order:

1. being asked, as a 3 year old child, if mommy and daddy should get a divorce
2. growing up in a house that continued to decay and worsen in its clutter until it was sold in 2023
3. having eczema so bad that my arms and legs were covered in bright red scabs, because my parents knew I was allergic to dogs[^14] and continued to adopt and own them
4. having allergic asthma so bad that I routinely used a rescue inhaler along with Allegra-D daily because my parents didn't care enough to clean the house properly
5. being parentified by my mother in order to care for the family and her emotional wellbeing

These experiences, in large part, are why I was so afraid of having a child. Furthermore, with the amount of deprioritizing myself and emotional labor I performed as a child, I was very uncertain as to if *I* wanted kids, or if I wanted to fulfill my wife's desires. At this point, I can tell you very confidently that *I* wanted kids.

### *The ADHD*

My experience growing up with undiagnosed ADHD wasn't *terrible* relative to what I've read from others, but it definitely affected, and was also affected by, my [Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:. The negative feedback that I received as a child was persistent, and I was more prone to interpreting that feedback in a worse way. Growing up with ADHD makes you inherently more prone to avoiding negative feedback or failure. According to an article on additudemag.com, "Some experts, like William Dodson, M.D., estimate that children with ADHD receive a full 20,000 more negative messages by age 10, on average[^15]." This disparity in negative reinforcement was tangible for me as a child. I was taught to sit on my hands to avoid outbursts in class. I was never a "problem" like many children who grow up with ADHD in that my behaviour was generally not "unproductive" because I was very interested in participating and learning in class. As an aside, this is part of the reason why I went undiagnosed until college. These negative reinforcements also had a tangible effect in how I process rejection. Rejection can mean many different things to many different people. In this case, I'm referring to an occurance where someone or something provides feedback to me that does not (or is perceived to not) affirm myself or my understanding of reality. As of writing, Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) doesn't have much in the way of research, but it does seem to affect people with ADHD (and likely others with neurodivergence) at a higher rate than those who are neurotypical[^16].

Without going into too much detail, as this blog post is already starting to creep outside of my initial goal, I want to briefly explain why my ADHD experience affected my decision making process around having a child. The mass of negative reinforcement I had as a child was bad for developing a fear of failure, sure, but I don't believe that's the whole of the story, either. My understanding of failure is much more rigid when applied to myself than others, which is a large part of why I was so afraid to "fail" as a father. My father failed me as a father and parent. Full stop, no further discussion needed there. However, because I felt that way and "knew" it as truth, I didn't actually interrogate how many times and in how many ways my father failed me. There are so many clear instances where that's happened that the intrinsic understanding of failure is self evident. I, realistically, don't have to feel afraid of that kind of failure. And yet I do, and I am constantly afraid of my failings negatively affecting my child. That's something I will need to work through, but that fear can be a productive part of avoiding moment to moment failures. Everyone fails every day of their life in one way or another. Some people fail more, some less, but there isn't a person in the world that doesn't fail at something every day. Shifting the perspective this way can help me feel more in control of my failures and view them as a part of life, but not a fatalistic inevitability like my parents did. This is starting to bleed back into my [Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:, but my mother was constantly talking about becoming her mother[^17]. This was profoundly damaging because she talked about it with such certainty that it felt as though I had no choice but to become my parents. I have tendencies towards that, sure,  but my understanding of my Trauma:tm: and my desire to make a better life for me, my wife, and my daughter will prevent that from happening intrinsically. Is it hard? *Absolutely*, but that's the only certainty I can see. Life can be hard, but it's worth the effort you put into it if it ensures you live your life with passion, love, and empathy.

### *The Birth*

The week my daughter was born is perhaps the most stressful time in my life. My daughter was born on a Saturday, and we left the hospital that Sunday. That night, we were unable to get her to sleep in her crib. She was, for lack of a better word, unconsoleable. We called an on-call nurse, and she recommended we either bring her into the ER or get a PCP visit scheduled immediately. We decided to take her to the hospital. There, we discovered, because we had not yet gotten a child-safe thermometer, that her body temperature was 34.5 degrees celsius. The children's ER admits under 36 degrees celsius. My wife and I were absolutely terrified. We were sleep deprived and feared the worst. *My daughter might be taken away from me, so soon after I met her.* They were having trouble getting an IV for her, because of how young she was and how small her veins were. The ER doctor told us they were concerned about infection, so they wanted to do a lumbar puncture along with several other tests. That sent both my wife and I over the edge. *A lumbar puncture and she's not even 3 days old? How could she already be this sick? Did we do something wrong?* The ER nurses called in the NICU nurses because they're more experienced with small veins in newborns. I was so upset and delirious I couldn't be there for the IV. I was shown a room where I could drink a Gatorade and attempt to close my eyes for a bit. I just couldn't hear her in pain any longer at that moment. I felt so guilty, so tired, so much a failure as a father that I couldn't understand why I'd bother having kids in the first place. 

My wife woke me up, I'm not sure how long I was asleep, but I felt rested enough to go back to the room. They were about to admit her to the NICU because of "logistics." We were told that they only put her there and not the ER because they wanted to avoid filling the ER beds if possible. I don't really believe that. I suspect they just wanted us to feel better about her being in the NICU. Regardless, we became even more distraught as we walked to the NICU. There, I felt this strange sense of relief and terror that I hope I never have to feel again. As soon as my daughter was in the room, 3 or 4 nurses swarmed over her to get things done. The care that I could sense from them and the nurse talking to us was overwhelming and even recalling it is making me tear up. They made an effort to reassure us, and encourage us to care for ourselves. It was incredibly hard to do that, but we managed. Stepping back a bit, my daughter was born incredibly quickly, in around 7 hours. The actual pushing lasted only about 30 minutes, and because of that my wife's body was not prepared adequately. She suffered level 4 tearing. Based on what the OB told us, that's the worst you can get, and he only sees it every 2-3 years. My wife was still healing from a grievous wound when all of this was happening, and she didn't take her round of antibiotics she needed. She was feeling weak and shakey, and for that reason I and the nurse more or less forced her to go to the ER[^18]. Looking back, it was clear my wife was just suffering from sleep deprivation and severe anxiety. At the time, however, I couldn't fathom losing my wife to a completely preventable infection and having to go through the rest of this unknown quantity of an ER visit for my daughter on my own.

After a second follow up with the neonatologist[^19], she made it clear there would be no lumbar puncture, and there was likely no infection. The cultures hadn't completed yet, but they were clean so far, and she was relatively certain there was nothing wrong here except a cold baby and an underfed one. Their policy, however, is that they keep her for at least 3 days to monitor her health. I was actually relieved hearing that. The lack of sleep continued to be alarmingly hard for me to work through, and my wife, from what she's told me, was concerned about that as well. As we were leaving that night, to go back to our house, I felt a twinge in my side that I had felt before. It almost felt like a pinch inside my intestines, kind of like bad gas. I thought it was either that or constipation. My stomach always gets knotted up when I'm anxious, and I wasn't all that surprised to be feeling that right now. I had just gone through the worst experience in my life, after all. The twinge, stitch, pinch didn't resolve while my daughter was in the NICU. She continued to improve, and it became clear that she was one of the nurses' favorites to see because of how vigorous and lively she was[^20]. We were discharged on Thursday and my mother-in-law was there to help us get everything out of the room and into our car. She was staying with us as we got acclimated to baby life. That night, I worked harder than I think I ever have in my life. My daughter was, like a newborn, away very often. We would alternate and we were sleeping on a shikibuton[^21]. Getting up from that position with the pain in my side and the amount of sleep inertia I had felt nearly impossible to me at the time. And yet, to help my wife and my daughter, I managed. Friday night, after a visit from my brother-in-law and his wife, I expressed concern, as I often do, about my stomach. My wife, at this point, was quite worried and exasperated with my anxiety. The pain hadn't improved since Monday night, and I had been able to rule out constipation and gas. Both my mother-in-law and my wife suggested I go to the ER to check it out. I have pretty severe medical anxiety, and hearing that was worrying to me. My wife grew up in a household where the culture was "you're fine, it's fine" when it came to medical things. They would take issues seriously, but they were always cautious about getting medical intervention. My family, on the extreme opposite, constantly went to PCPs and urgent care to get issues evaluated. My instinct is to go the ER at the slightest issue, and my wife finds it relatively frustrating[^22].

I head out to the ER on my own, quite worried about what they'll find. Logically, I understand it's probably something minor that a PCP could have found, but my anxiety around health issues is quite hard to manage. I get there, and I talk to the intake nurse. I tell him about what exactly I'm feeling and how it's quite confusing because I've been able to pass gas and stool with no more issue than I normally do. I'm brought into triage and talk to another nurse and tell him the same thing. He pokes and prods, as nurses do, and asks me if it hurts more or less or the same. I provide answers as best I can. It doesn't seem to follow a specific pattern, but sometimes pressure even helps. I was told they were going to order an ultrasound, which I've had before, and he exits the room. A couple of minutes later I'm brought into a CT room, which is confusing. *They must have changed the order for whatever reason.* I confirm that she's supposed to be doing a CT and not an ultrasound and I get the weird contrast injected into my IV that makes you feel like you're peeing your pants[^23]. The CT goes through without any issues and I'm sent back to triage. I wait longer and one of the ER physicians comes in and talks to me about what he's seen so far in the CT. He can't get an exact understanding based on the minimal data he's allowed to see through the portal but within an hour, he says, a radiologist will have had time to take a look at the scan with much more information than the ER physician is allowed to see in his portal. Before he leaves, he states plainly that it doesn't look like appendicitis, but if it's not that he doesn't know exactly what it is based on the areas that "lit up." He exits the room and, not even 10 minutes later, walks back in and sits down with the air of a camp counselor about to talk to a misbehaving student. Like he was about to turn the chair around and say "*what's goin' on, bud?*" He informs me it was absolutely appendicitis despite the weird location of what was marked as an anomaly, and it was very infected. He tells me they're going to admit me to prepare for surgery, but that they'll need to discharge me and then readmit me at another hospital[^24]. I'm told by the nurse that admitted me and is now in charge of administering antibiotics prior to discharging me that he's impressed by my pain tolerance. I look at him with a weird face and ask "uh, why?" The pain I'm dealing with isn't at all what I've been told is how appendicitis feels. He recounts how well I walked and how easily I talk and shift my body. "*I've seen people who can't even speak it hurts so bad.*" I'm almost proud, but it just doesn't feel right, because pain tolerance isn't really a thing you cultivate or develop. You either have it or you don't, and it still feels like stolen valor to me because I've already felt this kind of pain before. I send my wife a nearly incoherent video message about the situation and she calls immediately to discuss it. She reassures me that things will be okay. I feel upset and guilty that I'm in need of help. *I shouldn't be dealing with this right now, this isn't fair to my wife, her mother, or my daughter. My daughter needs me. My wife needs me.* I attempt to steel myself and talk with my nurse about what's going to happen. I asked to be discharged so that I could drive the car back to my house and pick up my wife. We only have one car, my pain isn't that bad, and taking the ambulance seems quite unnecessary. I get discharged, and it feels like my body is vibrating.

What happens after that feels very mechanical. I get in the car, take a deep breath, and drive back home. My wife put together a "go bag" for me, and I can't stop apologizing to her. My tears are blocked up, like I can't cry but I want to. *This isn't fair to her, why does this have to happen now?* I say goodbye to my mother-in-law and my daughter and reluctantly head outside. We get into the car and I take another deep breath before driving another 15 minutes to the hospital. I make a joke out of how funny it'll be to tell people I drove myself to the ER, back home, and to another hospital while having appendicitis. When I'm scared or worried, that's all I feel capable of doing. It's not even something I process, it's just instinctual.

We get to the hospital and walk to the surgery ward. It's eerie, because it's late at night and no one is at the desk. A woman is in the waiting room. The sign says to call a number on the desk phone to get checked in. A woman in surgery garb opens the door behind the desk and asks us who we are. We tell them and she acknowledges the other hospital contacted them about me. I get walked over to my section of the, what seems like, donut-shaped room. I need to get changed into the the surgery gown that was handed to me. I have trouble, so my wife has to get into the bathroom with me to help. I continue being chipper and silly, and I send a couple pictures to people with funny faces and my surgery gown clearly visible and make mention of my impending surgery. I wait underneath some sort of heating blanket[^25], and get checked in, again. I finally meet the surgeon and ask a bit about the procedure. I sign a consent form for laparoscopic surgery with posibility for standard surgery. I mention to the surgeon that I've felt this before and that I think I've had appendicitis that resolved on its own. My wife and the surgeon both give me a look and say that that's very unlikely. I talk to the anesthesiologist, sign that consent form, and they get me some drugs that make me lose consciousness quickly because I mentioned my level of anxiety. I regain consciousness once I've been wheeled to my recovery room. I'm quite uncomfortable and tired, but alive, so I try to stay positive. I cry to my wife about how guilty I feel about not being able to help her. The tears come easily, since I'm so uninhibited by the pain medication. My wife mentions to me that the surgery was more complicated than expected because of the size of my appendix and the fact that it was adhered with scar tissue behind my colon. "*The surgeon told me we owed you an apology. You most definitely had appendicitis previously, and he wouldn't be surprised if you had been dealing with this for years. No wonder you've been so tired lately.*" It took a while for me to process that. When I woke up again, my wife was gone. I've been in and out of consciousness for a while, being woken up by nurses checking in on me. I won't narrate the whole recovery process, it's boring and long. I was in the hospital for 4 days. Gas pain[^26] is some of the worst pain I've ever felt. I was told it happens because surgeons have to blow gas into my abdomen to get access to my organs. It feels like a pain that starts in my lower back and worms it way into my shoulders. It's unbearable, much worse than the pain from the incisions. I am discharged, sans gas pain[^27], and return home feeling anxious about the remaining recovery to come.

[^18]: the pediatric hospital and the main hospital are separate entities but were attached, so it was not much of a walk to get there
[^19]: and some sleep on the "bed" they have in all the NICU rooms
[^20]: that hasn't changed in the nearly 5 months she's been around!
[^21]: a japanese floor mattress
[^22]: I've gotten better at it! But the instinct is still there. 
[^23]: I didn't believe her when she said it would. Quite a wild feeling.
[^24]: the same one that my wife gave birth in. They don't have a stamp card, sadly...
[^25]: it's a thermal reflective blanket that they're filling with hot air
[^26]: not *that* gas pain
[^27]: the cure is literally just walking; real easy to do that when you're post-surgery! :rolling_eyes:

### *The Aftermath*

As I've mentioned many times now, this is much longer than I meant it to be. I don't feel a need to recount all the events during my recovery, so I will focus on highlights. I was still exhausted, of course, and a couple of times tried pushing myself to support or contribute where I thought I *should*. These attempts went poorly, and proceeded to make me feel worse about my worth as a dad and husband. I feel uncomfortable and guilty asking for what I need. I don't know what's a *need* and what's a *desire* out of anxiety regarding childcare and helping my wife. I attempted to care for my daughter alone one day and, in hindsight, that was an awful idea. I was tired, and I wasn't able to rationally deduce what might be wrong with my daughter when she starts crying. Many times, since becoming a parent, we have been warned about shaken baby syndrome. We've seen some egregious "re-enactments" that are meant to illustrate how horrifying it is. At this point in my day, trying and failing to understand and respond to my daughter's needs, I am becoming frustrated and overwhelmed. While holding her, I see a flash of one of those "re-enactments" and I freeze. I put my daughter down in the crib and, shaking from fear, disgust, confusion, and surprise, call my wife. I'm upstairs and my daughter is crying downstairs, I hear her in the background. I try, and fail, to explain what happened appropriately. My wife and mother-in-law get home and, later that night, talk to me about their concerns. I, still feeling anxious and upset, cannot properly explain what I experienced. I mentioned seeing upsetting images on the phone, and they interpretted that as what I was thinking of doing. I try to metacognate as best I can. I sit in silence for a long time, and attempt to explain more clearly. To me, it feels like the whole explanation is more damning, but as I recount what I experienced, I realized that my mind was trying warn me about where that frustration might lead, not what I wanted to do. I talk with my wife more and mention the fact that I should probably get back on an SSRI, because my anxiety is unmanageable right now. My wife looks up and confirms that it's likely I'm suffering from paternal post-partum depression[^28]. Apparently, this is a physical problem, and not purely psychological, as I suspected. When a child is born and you're a primary caretaker for them, a man's testosterone *plummets*. This is what can cause the anxiety and depression I've been experiencing since my daughter was born. I already struggled with depression and anxiety before this, but have been on and off of SSRIs because of my inability to accept that medication like that *aids* in managing symptoms. *It isn't a cure.* Prior to the medication, everything about my child was terrifying. *What if I forget something, and she's taken away from us? What if I set her down to quickly? What if I pick her up too quickly? What if I'm not careful enough? I can't have her back in the ER again. I won't, but I'm so scared she'll have to go back again.* I was basically inconsoleable when I got like this. It felt so *wrong* that I was making my wife take care of me emotional *again*. *Stop it, you need to be better. Get a grip, do you want to end up like your father?* While waiting for the prescription and the subsequent "ramp up" for the medication, things started getting better. The anxiety around frustration and mistakes gradually became quieter and easier to deal with. 

### *The Conclusion*

Since then, I've felt more confident around childcare, and my outlook on personal failings and mistakes became less of a direct problem. Anxiety leads to more mistakes, which in turn leads to more anxiety. If there's one thing I want other fathers, husbands, and men to learn from this, it's this:

> **There is nothing wrong in needing help and asking for it. It isn't a personal failing when you are emotionally honest with your loved ones. They don't think you're dead weight; they won't leave you over it. It's your duty as a partner, child, parent, sibling, or friend to be as healthy as you can in both body and mind so that you can reciprocate the support and care when your loved ones need you most.**

My daughter has changed my outlook on how I deal with personal conflict. Previously, I was entirely avoidant regarding it. I still do that instinctually. However, when I am mistreated at work or another area of my life, I want my daughter to see me standing up for what I deserve: respect and empathy. I don't want her to just see me being brave or courageous in action. I want her to see the worry, anxiety, and fear that I have prior to confronting my manager or co-worker. I grew up seeing my father never advocate for herself, and my mother did so constantly at work, seeming without any thought. Like it was instinctual for her. I don't believe that was the case, and if I saw the consternation she went through internally before doing something like putting your job on the line for a raise or better working conditions, I'd probably find it easier to do so myself. So, I want to be what my parents weren't. I want to be a human model. Not a "good role model", or a "bad role model", but a model that she can understand and critically examine with context for how I was raised. She doesn't need a model for her "role" in life, but she does need a model for how humans are and will always be: perfectly imperfect and always striving to do better for themselves and others.
