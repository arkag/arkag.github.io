## Fatherhood

I've recently noticed that a lot of my negative thought patterns have changed rather significantly. This is in spite of a significant increase in my work stress. I don't believe any choice or life change is a silver bullet for "fixing" your internal world, but I do think that the self-discovery and self-improvement I did prior to having my daughter[^1] tangibly changed how I've been seeing the world after my daughter was born. My primary goal around this post is to discuss how I've previously dealt with negative situations or thought patterns and how a lot of those have seriously minimized or outright vanished now that I'm a father. **Again**, I am not claiming that this is the only reason I've changed. This feels like one of the most significant inflection points in my life, and I wasn't expecting that to be the case. At least, not in the way that it has been significant. As you grow up in a male body[^2], you gain a certain understanding of how fatherhood specifically might affect a person. For me, this started off as an feeling that that's when your life ends. This is in part related to [The Trauma](#trauma):tm:, but AMAB's[^3] are generally taught from a young age to feel negatively toward fatherhood and marriage. Culturally, American content made *"for the guys"* was[^4] a mixture of *"women bad or annoying"* comedy and *"[don't get] chained down by a family"* stories focused on young boys/men in some sort of action world or a man *"in a rut"* because of his *"stupid family"*. Around middle school, I started being interested in girls[^5], but still had an aversion to the concept of marriage or fatherhood because of the media I was exposed to. In highschool this hadn't really changed, but I began having an awareness of [The Trauma](#trauma):tm: in that I understood how badly a marriage could end up. This compounded the aversion I had because of societal norms with the fear I have from [The Trauma](#trauma):tm:. This made the decision for both marriage, and *eventually* fatherhood, very difficult to work through. Here's a few of the thoughts I had during both decisions:

1. Did I even want this?
2. Did I want this because I wanted this or because I was raised to want this by society?
3. You're just going to replicate your [Trauma](#trauma):tm:, why bother?
4. You won't be a good father/spouse because your rolemodels were terrible.
5. This is a huge change, and big life changes are scary.
6. What if it gets taken away? (divorce, death)
7. If it might end, why bother?

These specifically made it very hard to actually decide one way another. Luckily, I had a patient, loving, and understanding girlfriend/wife when going through these throes. Inevitably, I had to take the plunge despite these uncertainties. I can't say it's been a walk in the park with either, because nothing important is ever **truly** easy, but I can't imagine my life having gone any other way. I don't believe I'd have been able to work through [The Trauma](#trauma):tm: without my wife, and both my daughter and wife have made my life so impossibly full of joy.

### <a name="trauma"></a> *The Trauma*

CW: hording, medical neglect, emotional neglect, negative self-talk, complex PTSD, non-specific domestic violence, self-harm

I pretty regularly have a hard time reckoning with how bad my childhood *truly* was. Very often, I find myself hedging with the description using phrases like:

1. I don't want to make it seem like my childhood was the worst ever.
2. I know plenty of other people have gone through worse.
3. It might have been bad, but it wasn't all bad.

In fact, I wanted to start this section off with one of these, and I had to actively stop myself from doing that. There is nothing wrong with discussing how terrible my childhood was. In fact, I believe it's important to enable visbility around the kind of emotional and physical neglect I was subjected to. Do I feel bad about putting my parents on blast like this? Absolutely. However, I feel as though if I had some other experiences like mine to compare to, it would have been much easier for me to come to grips with the trauma I was subjected to. I have no way of knowing how "common" trauma like this is, but it's always been hard for me to "feel better" about my childhood, in large part, because of the lack of people who *really* get it. Anyway, let's talk about trauma!

My parents are[^6] horders. I don't use that label lightly. My aunt, who died of stomach cancer shortly afterwards, was on the TBS show Horders. Both of my parents come from a long line of horders, and I have many horror stories I could, **BUT WON'T**, tell. Right now, anyway. I use this to merely set the stage for how I grew up. I remember my father[^7] as very absent. My father got on disability very early into my childhood[^8], and basically became a stay-at-home dad. Sadly, that was the worst thing that could have happened to her, in my opinion. Outside of *few* exceptions, I remember my father sitting in front of the computer getting angry at people online. She did very little around the house, and even less to contribute to her fulfillment with life. I recognize now how truly unhappy she was, but she **still** makes those choices, so I'm unsure what's actually going on in her mind. My parents' relationship was fraught, to say the least. I remember my parents fighting *constantly* as a child. I can't recall exactly what they fought about generally, but I distinctly remember fights that were, on the surface, about household chores my father failed to do. My mother was a teacher the entirety of my memory, but she apparently worked as a consultant doing programming with things like COBOL. My relationship with my parents is, needless to say, quite complicated. There's an amount of empathy I have for my parents and both their situations, and amount of pride I have in my mother, but they failed me as parents.

[^6]: were? My mom passed in 2022, so I guess you could say she finally kicked it :rofl:
[^7]: She is trans, so I am using her preferred pronouns here (she/her/hers)
[^8]: I was 10 or 11, I think

#### <a name="failure"></a> *The Failure*

Both of my parents are horrendous at emotionally connecting with me. After quite a bit of therapy, I finally have a good understanding of *why* that connection never happened. My current therapist[^9] recommended I read through "Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents," by Lindsay C. Gibson[^10]. In this book, I found an immense amount of understanding and reasoning for why I've felt how I do about my parents since I left my childhood home for college. Without attempting to synthesize the entire book into a quick blurb, the jist of it is that parents like the ones I have are more common than you'd realize, and there are varying degrees to how emotionally immature they are. These kinds of parents *all* contribute to some amount of emotional neglect for their children. To me, a large part of my trauma could have been managed through emotional connection early on in my childhood, but I didn't get that, so it sat dormant until I was far enough removed from the damaging family dynamic I grew up in to actually rear its ugly head.

Let me level with you: I remember **very** little of my early childhood. I have a few neutral/happy memories that I can actively recall when I was young. Outside of that, it's more or less blank. My memory during school seems to be better, but still was not great overall. I believe I was dealing with depression for a large portion of *at least* middle school and high school. This could be, in part, due to my undiagnosed [ADHD](#trauma), but I'll discuss that more in that section. Without a crystal ball, or some amount of biased retelling from my parents (one of whom is dead), I can't really know what this is due to. At this point, I'm pretty confident my lack of memory is a result of my parents' near constant fighting and some very bad things relatively early on in my childhood.

I have an innocuous[^11] memory of playing outside behind my childhood home with one of the ladies who ran the private daycare I went to as a small child. As I grew up, that memory still managed to stick with me and I was never really sure why.Â Of course, sometimes there's nothing specific about a memory that would make it stick with you. This one just confused me, though. Why would I remember this specifically instead of something with my parents or something happier? I don't remember how I felt at the time, but that's part of why it's so confusing to remember that specific snippet. Of course, I imagine people reading can see where this is going, that memory very well might still be innocuous, but it's more likely related to a particularly bad event at my house. My father's been through the gamut regarding psychiatric treament. She's been on, probably, every potential treatment possible for her mental illnesses[^12]. Based on things I've been told by other family members who heard about the incident, my dad reacted *really poorly* to one of these drugs. During this time, she was angry and throwing things around the house. My mom was scared she'd get hurt, and stood behind *me*[^13]. After my father stormed out of the room where this was happening, my mom called 911 to report what was happening. At that time, my father took some number of pills in an attempt to end her life. I don't remember *any* of this, but I do remember being outside, and seeing ambulances through our chainlink fence while I bounced a ball on our small patio. I was confused, and I probably didn't even really understand how scared I *should* have been.

Given this story was *told* to me, it's very possible I'm selecting remembering things that didn't actually occur to make sense of this specific memory. That said, it was what got my mom to tell me about it. Then, the story was expanded upon by my dad and uncle. I don't really know if retroactive trauma is possible, but it does make me immensely sad to think about. This was, I *think*, the worst it got based on what I've been told. There are plenty of other negative stories I've been told, however. In no particular order:

1. being asked, as a 3 year old child, if mommy and daddy should get a divorce
2. growing up in a house that continued to decay and worsen in its clutter until it was sold in 2023
3. having eczema so bad that my arms and legs were covered in bright red scabs, because my parents knew I was allergic to dogs[^14] and continued to adopt and own them
4. having allergic asthma so bad that I routinely used a rescue inhaler along with Allegra-D daily because my parents didn't care enough to clean the house properly
5. being parentified by my mother in order to care for the family and her emotional wellbeing

[^10]: I absolutely recommend this book! Please check it out of your local library, or buy it from your local bookstore. If you want an audiobook, I'd recommend [Libro.fm](https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781515977025?rf_code=lfm399790)(referral link)
[^11]: foreshadowing: a literary device in which a writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story
[^12]: really, it's probably more likely that she was a closeted trans woman for most of her life
[^13]: my father claims it was because my mom knew that my father wouldn't hurt me, but I don't really think it matters
[^14]: and a bunch of other things, if they cleaned the house like they ought to, it likely wouldn't have mattered as much

### <a name="adhd"></a> *The ADHD*

My experience growing up with undiagnosed ADHD wasn't *terrible* relative to what I've read from others, but it definitely affected, and was also affected by, my [Trauma](#the-trauma):tm:. The negative feedback that I received as a child was persistent, and I was more prone to interpreting that feedback in a worse way. %SOMETHING ABOUT NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT% %SOMETHING ABOUT REJECTION SENSITIVITY%
