## Fatherhood

I've recently noticed that a lot of my negative thought patterns have changed rather significantly. This is in spite of a significant increase in my work stress. I don't believe any choice or life change is a silver bullet for "fixing" your internal world, but I do think that the self-discovery and self-improvement I did prior to having my daughter[^1] tangibly changed how I've been seeing the world after my daughter was born. My primary goal around this post is to discuss how I've previously dealt with negative situations or thought patterns and how a lot of those have seriously minimized or outright vanished now that I'm a father. **Again**, I am not claiming that this is the only reason I've changed. This feels like one of the most significant inflection points in my life, and I wasn't expecting that to be the case. At least, not in the way that it has been significant. As you grow up in a male body[^2], you gain a certain understanding of how fatherhood specifically might affect a person. For me, this started off as an feeling that that's when your life ends. This is in part related to [The Trauma](#trauma):tm:, but AMAB's[^3] are generally taught from a young age to feel negatively toward fatherhood and marriage. Culturally, American content made *"for the guys"* was[^4] a mixture of *"women bad or annoying"* comedy and *"[don't get] chained down by a family"* stories focused on young boys/men in some sort of action world or a man *"in a rut"* because of his *"stupid family"*. Around middle school, I started being interested in girls[^5], but still had an aversion to the concept of marriage or fatherhood because of the media I was exposed to. In highschool this hadn't really changed, but I began having an awareness of [The Trauma](#trauma):tm: in that I understood how badly a marriage could end up. This compounded the aversion I had because of societal norms with the fear I have from [The Trauma](#trauma):tm:. This made the decision for both marriage, and *eventually* fatherhood, very difficult to work through. Here's a few of the thoughts I had during both decisions:

1. Did I even want this?
2. Did I want this because I wanted this or because I was raised to want this by society?
3. You're just going to replicate your [Trauma](#trauma):tm:, why bother?
4. You won't be a good father/spouse because your rolemodels were terrible.
5. This is a huge change, and big life changes are scary.
6. What if it gets taken away? (divorce, death)
7. If it might end, why bother?

These specifically made it very hard to actually decide one way another. Luckily, I had a patient, loving, and understanding girlfriend/wife when going through these throes. Inevitably, I had to take the plunge despite these uncertainties. I can't say it's been a walk in the park with either, because nothing important is ever **truly** easy, but I can't imagine my life having gone any other way. I don't believe I'd have been able to work through [The Trauma](#trauma):tm: without my wife, and both my daughter and wife have made my life so impossibly full of joy. 

[^1]: my first child
[^2]: verbiage modified for inclusivity, come at me un-woke de-moralists
[^3]: assigned male at birth
[^4]: I would have no way of knowing if this is still the case generally, I'm too good at curating my own content on the internet nowadays, and I would have no way of knowing what content a young AMAB would experience either
[^5]: I'm using this verbiage to fit my thoughts at the time, which meant I didn't have an understand of gender in the way I do now

I pretty regularly have a hard time reckoning with how bad my childhood *truly* was. Very often, I find myself hedging with the description using phrases like:

1. I don't want to make it seem like my childhood was the worst ever.
2. I know plenty of other people have gone through worse.
3. It might have been bad, but it wasn't all bad.

In fact, I wanted to start this section off with one of these, and I had to actively stop myself from doing that.
