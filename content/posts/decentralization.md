## Decentralization

### A story

I've been fascinated by the internet since I was a small child using my uncle's old ThinkPad and ruining the Windows installation by installing 400 different cursors (and at least that much malware).

Slowly, as I grew up, I watched the internet change from a place where anything was possible to a place where that idea seems quaint and unlikely. This process seemingly happened all at once, but I believe that's partly to do with the idea that these websites that run our lives (Facebook, Twitter, Google) weren't originally walled gardens where data was hoarded. They were still taking that data, sure, but other's outside of the website could leverage that data as well for things like integrations or interoperability. People much more eloquent and experienced than me have been documenting and researching this phenomenon since the internet has existed, and I believe Cory Doctorow's term "enshittification" is an important aspect to this. However, there are new technologies being leveraged on the internet that can seem positive and improvements over the current internet, but will either never actually become a part of the internet in a meaningful way or are merely tools being used by those who want the centralization of power for themselves.

### Different definitions

"**Decentralized**" is a buzz-word that is prevelant all over the web when it comes to new technologies. However, this word can mean two **very** different things depending on who's using it. What's worse, it can be very difficult to determine who the person using the word *is*. Decentralized services sound like a good thing, right? When we imagine the word, it sounds fantastic and much more open and free than the internet currently is. Blockchain, I believe, has made that sell a lot more difficult. **To be clear**, I am not calling all blockchain technologies or services inherently bad. I am merely trying to draw attention to the fact that "**decentralized**" as a term has had it's image tarnished because of the many, **many**, scams and scandals that have come out of the cryptocurrency (and by association blockchain) space. Again, for those in the back, **I am not saying that all blockchain projects are bad**.

I believe the fact that these terms have been linked in a strong way to one another has made it harder to convince non-technologically inclined persons (NTIP, can I make that a thing?) to give legitimate and well supported decentralized platforms a try. What can make this sell even harder is that we have people on the crypto side attempting to support and foster growth for these other projects as well. Again, I don't think this is necessarily bad, but I believe the image crypto has, in many ways rightfully, earned has started to rub off on all decentralized services, not just things attached to Logan Paul or whoever's currently running a pump and dump coin.

Outside of blockchain technologies, there exists a plethora of other decentralized services. Without looking for more, I can name [libre.fm](https://libre.fm)(though, it's not currently usable by a beginner without a lot of additional reading and learning), [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), and [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org). These services are designed to be resilient, configurable, and support the idea that, if you don't like your current instance (what your account is set up on and where your data is stored), you can take it and move to another instance without losing everything and having to start over. Instances are managed by people, a team, a company, or a plethora of other organizational indentifiers. These organizations can manage things like how content is moderated, terms of service, and privacy policies. If an instance changes suddenly or becomes defunct, you can move with minimal effort. 

These two different types of decentralization can comingle as well, which becomes challenging to understand if you're an NTIP. Blockchain techologies typically run off of some sort of peer-to-peer protocol, but I'm not as invested in this technology as I used to be. These protocols can be a security nightmare, and also complicate an already complicated process for an NTIP. Web3 is an interesting idea, and I'm all for new standards, but I'm concerned it will never mature enough to encourage people to shift from the current internet (Web1 and Web2) to a completely different paradigm. I'm sure I've scared away any hiring manager that might be working for a crypto company now, but that's okay. I'm not willing to lie about how I feel when it's comes to technology. I won't sugar coat it, and I'm more than willing to change my mind if something happens in the space. 

### Wolves in decentralized clothing

The idea I'd like to share regarding decentralized technology mimics a lot of "political theory"(Youtube essays I've watched or podcasts I've listened to; I'm not an academic) I'm aware of regarding how Anarchists treat Anarcho-Capitalists(AnComs) in their circles. AnComs are, according to Anarchists, a walking contradiction. 

#### A tangent on the idea of Anarchy

The philosophy around Anarchism is primarily focused on the idea that heirarchies are inherently bad, and should be avoided or dismantled whenever they crop up. No, they're not all wearing Guy Fawkes masks and attempting to do terrorism. Crazy, right? It also doesn't mean "no government and no rules." In fact, Anarchy as a political philosphy is really just an umbrella term. At least, that's how I've interpreted it. Once the heirarchies have been dismantled (peacefully, please don't come after me for advocating violence, I'm just a nerd on the internet), there are many different ideas around how society would be restructured. Noam Chomsky is a Anarcho-Syndicalist, generally meaning he is in favor of setting up trade unions that would span the gammut of trades and they would interact with each other to provide social services, laws, and regulation. Again, I'm not super well versed in the particulars of this, but I just wanted to establish that Anarchy as a concept has been villified by most modern societies because of a lack of knowledge surrounding it.
